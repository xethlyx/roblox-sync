# roblox-sync
Sync Roblox players manually to Bungee/Spigot networks

## How to use
Install this plugin into BungeeCord for most functionality. Optionally install this plugin onto Spigot to automatically update nicknames. This plugin does not work if installed standalone on a Spigot instance - the command and main functionality is on BungeeCord.

Main command: `/roblox` (Bungeecord)
